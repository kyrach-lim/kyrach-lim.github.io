	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
	<center><h4><p>As a newbie to adobe, "Facade" was my first time using photoshop on a project. In this assignment, I created a collage using various layers and images to illustrate a story from a picture. The message I hoped to deliver with this piece was that on the outside, the world may sometimes seem perfect - life might seem perfect. For some, looking into the mirror at the end of the day reminds us of reality and how we may wear a fake facade for society in order to fit in. Life isn't always as it seems.</p></h4></center>
